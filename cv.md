## Briefly About Myself:

I am a high school student, who is interested in Front-end web development, but now I'm just starting my path in it. I am very diligent, I am ready to work until I achieve significant results and it is important for me to achieve my own goals. For several years now I have been homeschooled, so self-education is not new for me and now I am even better at absorbing information on my own. I can describe myself as a person who is ready for self-improvement.

I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.
